.. note::
    This guide was written for OS X 10.10 and may be outdated. For a modern
    installation, please refer to the :doc:`ubuntu` guide or simply run
    ``pip install nsot`` on any system with Python 3.10+.

This tutorial is designed to get a working version of NSoT installed inside a
Mac OS X system.

Installation
============

Xcode
-----

It is assumed that you have a Mac, running macOS, and Xcode already installed.
If you don't have Xcode, please install it. You may need to agree to a command
line license. We suggest running this via command line prior to install:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ xcodebuild -license

Install NSoT
-------------

Install NSoT via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install nsot

Now you are ready to follow the :doc:`../quickstart` starting at step 2!
